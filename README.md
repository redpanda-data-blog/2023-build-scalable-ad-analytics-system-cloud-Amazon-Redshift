# How to integrate Redpanda and AWS-Redshift

This repository contains the resources and instructions for deploying a scalable ad analytics system leveraging Redpanda and AWS Redshift. The system aims to provide real-time insights into advertising data, crucial for optimizing ad campaigns.

## Overview

The project integrates Redpanda, an Apache Kafkaâ€“compatible event streaming platform, with AWS Redshift, a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service. The integration facilitates the ingestion, storage, and analysis of large-scale ad data, providing vital insights into ad performance metrics like impressions, clicks, conversions, and more.

## System Architecture

The architecture showcases the workflow from data generation to insights retrieval. The system ingests streaming ad data into Redpanda, transfers it to AWS Redshift via a JDBC Sink Connector, and then performs analytics queries on the data.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Docker 24.0.6+
- AWS Account with Redshift
